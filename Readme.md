### Code Snippet

```python
# Insert a relevant code snippet from your project to showcase a key feature or functionality.
# For example:
def display_score():
    # Function to display the player's score.

def obstacle_movement(obstacle_list):
    # Function to move obstacles across the screen.

def collissions(player,obstacle):
    # Function to check for collisions between the player and obstacles.

def player_animation():
    # Function to animate the player's movement.

# The main game loop and other functions.
```
